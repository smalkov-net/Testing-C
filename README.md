# Welcome to testing

**`Testing-C`** is your go-to tool for checking the essential libraries needed to install terminal programs written in C.

Onece you run it, you'll quickly find out if the necessary files are in place before you dive into the installation process - or if something's gone awry.

As René Decartes famously said, "Cogito, ergo sum"(I am thinking, therefore I exist)

To verify the existence of these libraries, the best approach is to run a program that works but doesn't actually do anything.

## How to Get Started
To launch the program, just follow the instrictions [here](http://hello.c/).

happy testing!
